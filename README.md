 Machine Learning is basically the function approximation which predicts things like humans.
 
 Steps for building a basic scratch model
 
 1. Describing data from csv files
 1. Deciding Features and Prediction columns from the data
 1. Quickly making a basic model to fit the data
 1. Make some raw low accurate prediction or failed model
 1. Starting analysis for the patterns

Some methods for building a more predictive model
1.Combining one or more types of model together
